The Moorings Restaurant quickly obtained a reputation for fine dining specializing in fresh seafood landed at the local pier. In 1998 the Bridge Bar underwent a complete transformation to become the very special place we know today – offering a warm and comfortable dining experience by the large open fire and a place to have a relaxing pint by the bar, along with a dance floor to accommodate the more active! The following year, eight new rooms were added to the Moorings Guesthouse with the emphasis on space, style and comfort.2006 saw the refurbishment of the original accommodation area and the addition of a further 5 rooms above the new Gift Shop, ‘Cois Cuain’. The Moorings Guesthouse “Best described as a restaurant with rooms, perhaps even a boutique hotel” now offers 4 stylish seaview mini suites complete with jacuzzi baths and 12 spacious rooms to accommodate our valued guests whether they be singles, couples or families. Everyone can be assured of a warm welcome and the highest standards of efficiency and attention to detail. In 2015 & 2017, Star Wars, The Force Awakens & The Last Jedi, were filmed on Skellig Michael in Portmagee. The Moorings was host to the pre production team of the movie. During the time of filming, the village was alive with media, journalists and Star Wars fans. Portmagee has since become a tourist hot spot for tourists and fans to visit the once “sleepy town of Portmagee” to listen to the stories from the locals and visit the Island where the magic took place. no -- Principals only.
