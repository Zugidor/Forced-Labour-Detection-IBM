LinkedInDescriptionOverview As a Luxury Travel Specialist you will design and sell personalised, tailor made trips to Ten’s members. No trip will be the same and you will go above and beyond to exceed the expectations of our members, building strong relationships and loyalty in our service along the way. You will handle the full sales and service cycle of a members’ journey, being their primary point of contact. You will constantly be on the look-out for how we can further support our members and make their trip even more special. This could include organising a nice meal, event or helping with recommendations of places for nice drinks. You will be part of a close knit team, helping and supporting one another and continuously sharing destination knowledge, especially all those insights you picked up during your personal travels. Who We AreAt Ten our goal is simple, to become the most trusted service business in the world. We are already the global market leader for lifestyle management and concierge services, providing services from a 22 strong global office network with over 800 employees. We use our expertise, technology and buying power to grant our members direct access to the best travel, live entertainment, dining and luxury retail services. We also work closely with suppliers to provide exclusively negotiated benefits and employee loyalty schemes. We deliver our service through a combination of Ten’s proprietary, unique technology-enabled platform and the expertise of our highly trained lifestyle managers. Ten is growing quickly and has ambitious plans to keep innovating, inspiring and to continue to improve the lives of millions of members. To find out more about working at Ten, hear from some of our people and have a sneak peek at our offices, please watch this short video here. Your key responsibilities will include: Establishing strong relationships with our members via telephone, truly understanding their travel preferences and interests; Planning and designing high quality, accurate and detailed itineraries reflecting our members’ brief and highlighting & helping with all the ‘need to knows’ before travelling such as visa or Covid requirements; Maintaining regular contact with members, helping them tailor itineraries further and using your exceptional sales skills to secure the bookings; Actively cross-selling our lifestyle services. RequirementsAbout youNeedless to say, you love all things travel – whether it’s a short weekend away, or a longer long haul trip, you are always up for it and love sharing your experiences with others. You have a proven track record of leisure sales, as well as worldwide itineraries, in a travel retail or tour operator environment. You are passionate about delivering high quality personalised service, are motivated and resourceful, and no itinerary is too big or complex for you. In fact, you a love a challenge and are great at thinking outside the box. You are a strong communicator, enjoy working in a fast paced environment and thrive on meeting and exceeding targets. You have sound knowledge of GDS (preferably Amadeus); you understand the Swiss market and Swiss members, and speak fluent German. BenefitsOur people are at the heart of the business and we have a culture of recognition and reward - both through regular appraisals but also annual Extra Mile Awards where we celebrate those who have gone that extra mile in their role. We also encourage all our staff to incorporate their aspirations and interests into their career at Ten and we are there every step of the way in supporting development. All our employees also enjoy a range of benefits regardless of where they are based. Not only do we offer a remote work option, but employees also get 3 extra days of annual leave in their third year and an extra month of every 5 years. In line with these milestone lengths of service, we also operate a Ten Loyalty Reward program – this is a bonus (although we prefer to refer to this as ‘extra spending money’) that is awarded once these milestones are reached. The thinking behind the program is that not only does it recognise and reward commitment and loyalty to the business, but it can also be used to fund the adventures to be had during sabbaticals – this is the main intention and driving force behind the program. We want to give our people extra spending money so that they can truly enjoy their sabbaticals. Other benefits that Ten offer, specific to the UK office, range between an employer-contributory company pension (with a scheme that allows full decision making about what investments are made, levels of risk, ethical funds etc), all the way through to various discounts on both travel and entertainment events (the latter is of course available regardless of location).We also offer season ticket loans, access to childcare voucher and cycle schemes and, one of our more popular perks, working holiday opportunities with the ability to work from any of our 20+ offices without taking annual leave. Ten works with a small Preferred Suppliers List currently, focused on specialists in each location. Please note we are not accepting any further agencies onto our PSL at this time.

Senior Engineer - RabbitMQ - Opportunity for Working Remotely,5242785705,"Location: EMEA/US/Canada/Americas/ - Remote or VMware officeSeeking an Americas or EMEA-based engineer who’s willing to work with the rest of the RabbitMQ engineering team distributed across the US and Europe. The time-zone spread of our development team requires someone who is flexible with attending weekly meetings on the edges of standard working hours. If you live near a VMware office you will be provided an office space and can take advantage of the many perks of the VMware workplace. If you do not live near a VMware office, you can work from home with occasional visits to your nearest office location, as well as the San Francisco and London VMware offices for team get-togethers.The Messaging and Streaming program is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are a learning organization and believe that diverse teams are stronger and more effective at solving the complex problems we make simple for our customers. Empathy, diverse points of view, approaches, and skill sets bring us to the best solution faster, together.BUSINESS SUMMARYVMware’s Messaging team delivers Tanzu RabbitMQ, a solution that’s essential to accelerating our customers’ journey to modern business application transformation. It’s our market-leading, state-of-the-art messaging platform designed to deliver reliable, secure application messaging across private, public, and hybrid clouds. Tanzu RabbitMQ is an integrated, comprehensive solution that meets the challenge of asynchronous enterprise application communication. We’re changing the way users design, build, view, and manage modern messaging architectures. Join our user-focused team of software engineers, designers, product managers, and marketers as we work together to pioneer new solutions in the strategic field of distributed computing and streaming on modern application platforms such as Kubernetes. JOB ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITYIn one line: We work on all things RabbitMQ on the VMware Tanzu platform.RabbitMQ has a collection of projects: the server, a dozen or so plugins, about as many client libraries (we maintain some and help with others when time permits). We are part of the Modern Applications Platform business at VMware and bringing strategic data services to Kubernetes is a key focus today.You will have a chance to work on many novel practical problems in the field of distributed systems on modern platforms: protocols, technical operations (“design for operability”, deployment and operation automation), and concurrency.We write our own docs, do our own QA, support our users and customers on the public mailing list and via internal VMware support resources. You may be working on more than one codebase on any given week, at the intersection of core RabbitMQ and Kubernetes. We participate and coordinate with a number of ecosystem projects that build on top or leverage RabbitMQ. (Examples include Spring AMQP, EasyNetQ, Spring Cloud Data Flow, Spring Cloud Stream, knative, RabbitMQ Reactor extension, Logstash, et cetera). REQUIRED SKILLSRemote work:Our team is reasonably small and geographically distributed: Expect all the awesome and less-than-awesome aspects of working on a small team. We communicate over email, Slack, and we meet via Zoom. Our public projects use Git(Hub) and a straightforward QA and merging process. Creativity and Initiative: No micromanagement or complicated processes are pushed on you: talk to the users daily, debug or design things, write code and tests, pass QA/code review, move on to the next thing. There is strategic product guidance and administrative assistance from our manager but the process provides for individual creativity and requires self-motivation. Most of the time (but not always: support and bugs obviously take priority), you have the freedom to choose an initiative to work on and to participate in roadmap planning. Remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Academic Interest in Stateful Distributed Computing on Modern Platform Architecture:This is the core of the innovation work we are doing today. We are solving challenging problems for our users and customers using the latest approaches in these fieldsPREFERRED SKILLS How Much Initial Erlang Experience is Required We work on multiple codebases, not all of them are in Erlang, some are really small. We'd consider any candidates with strong skills in any two of the following: Java, C#, (Python | Ruby), Objective-C, Swift, Go. Experience with a functional language would be a major plus but we're happy to let the candidate learn Erlang along the way. #TanzuThis position is eligible for JoinTeamTanzu referral campaignCategory : Engineering and TechnologySubcategory: Software EngineeringExperience: Business LeadershipFull Time/ Part Time: Full TimePosted Date: 2021-09-03VMware Company Overview: At VMware, we believe that software has the power to unlock new opportunities for people and our planet.

Who We AreAt Ten our goal is simple, to become the most trusted service business in the world. We are already the global market leader for lifestyle management and concierge services, providing services from a 22 strong global office network with over 800 employees. We use our expertise, technology and buying power to grant our members direct access to the best travel, live entertainment, dining and luxury retail services. We also work closely with suppliers to provide exclusively negotiated benefits and employee loyalty schemes. We deliver our service through a combination of Ten’s proprietary, unique technology-enabled platform and the expertise of our highly trained lifestyle managers. Ten is growing quickly and has ambitious plans to keep innovating, inspiring and to continue to improve the lives of millions of members. To find out more about working at Ten, hear from some of our people and have a sneak peek at our offices, please watch this short video here. We offer the option to work fully remotely for those who are based further away from our London office. If you are based in London, you will have the flexibility to do a mix of home and office work. RequirementsAbout youYou are highly organised, take pride in your work and are great at thinking outside the box. You have a strong desire both to consistently exceed your key performance indicators as well as for personal development, being determined to succeed and eager to take on the next challenge - or add the next set of skills to your already formidable arsenal. You are passionate about delivering high quality personalised service, are motivated and resourceful, and no request is too big or complex for you. In fact, you a love a challenge. You are a strong communicator, enjoy working in a fast paced environment and thrive on meeting and exceeding targets. You understand the Swiss market and Swiss members, and be fluent in written and spoken German. BenefitsOur people are at the heart of the business and we have a culture of recognition and reward - both through regular appraisals but also annual Extra Mile Awards where we celebrate those who have gone that extra mile in their role. We also encourage all our staff to incorporate their aspirations and interests into their career at Ten and we are there every step of the way in supporting development. All our employees also enjoy a range of benefits regardless of where they are based. Not only do we offer a remote work option, but employees also get 3 extra days of annual leave in their third year and an extra month of every 5 years. In line with these milestone lengths of service, we also operate a Ten Loyalty Reward program – this is a bonus (although we prefer to refer to this as ‘extra spending money’) that is awarded once these milestones are reached. The thinking behind the program is that not only does it recognise and reward commitment and loyalty to the business, but it can also be used to fund the adventures to be had during sabbaticals – this is the main intention and driving force behind the program. We want to give our people extra spending money so that they can truly enjoy their sabbaticals. Other benefits that Ten offer, specific to the UK office, range between an employer-contributory company pension (with a scheme that allows full decision making about what investments are made, levels of risk, ethical funds etc), all the way through to various discounts on both travel and entertainment events (the latter is of course available regardless of location).We also offer season ticket loans, access to childcare voucher and cycle schemes and, one of our more popular perks, working holiday opportunities with the ability to work from any of our 20+ offices without taking annual leave. Ten works with a small Preferred Suppliers List currently, focused on specialists in each location. Please note we are not accepting any further agencies onto our PSL at this time.
