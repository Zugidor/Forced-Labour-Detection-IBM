The time-zone spread of our development team requires someone who is flexible with attending weekly meetings on the edges of standard working hours. If you live near a VMware office you will be provided an office space and can take advantage of the many perks of the VMware workplace. If you do not live near a VMware office, you can work from home with occasional visits to your nearest office location, as well as the San Francisco and London VMware offices for team get-togethers.The Messaging and Streaming program is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are a learning organization and believe that diverse teams are stronger and more effective at solving the complex problems we make simple for our customers. Empathy, diverse points of view, approaches, and skill sets bring us to the best solution faster, together.BUSINESS SUMMARYVMware’s Messaging team delivers Tanzu RabbitMQ, a solution that’s essential to accelerating our customers’ journey to modern business application transformation. It’s our market-leading, state-of-the-art messaging platform designed to deliver reliable, secure application messaging across private, public, and hybrid clouds. Tanzu RabbitMQ is an integrated, comprehensive solution that meets the challenge of asynchronous enterprise application communication. We’re changing the way users design, build, view, and manage modern messaging architectures. Join our user-focused team of software engineers, designers, product managers, and marketers as we work together to pioneer new solutions in the strategic field of distributed computing and streaming on modern application platforms such as Kubernetes. JOB ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITYIn one line: We work on all things RabbitMQ on the VMware Tanzu platform.RabbitMQ has a collection of projects: the server, a dozen or so plugins, about as many client libraries (we maintain some and help with others when time permits). We are part of the Modern Applications Platform business at VMware and bringing strategic data services to Kubernetes is a key focus today.You will have a chance to work on many novel practical problems in the field of distributed systems on modern platforms: protocols, technical operations (“design for operability”, deployment and operation automation), and concurrency.We write our own docs, do our own QA, support our users and customers on the public mailing list and via internal VMware support resources. You may be working on more than one codebase on any given week, at the intersection of core RabbitMQ and Kubernetes. We participate and coordinate with a number of ecosystem projects that build on top or leverage RabbitMQ. (Examples include Spring AMQP, EasyNetQ, Spring Cloud Data Flow, Spring Cloud Stream, knative, RabbitMQ Reactor extension, Logstash, et cetera). REQUIRED SKILLSRemote work:Our team is reasonably small and geographically distributed: Expect all the awesome and less-than-awesome aspects of working on a small team. We communicate over email, Slack, and we meet via Zoom. Our public projects use Git(Hub) and a straightforward QA and merging process. Creativity and Initiative: No micromanagement or complicated processes are pushed on you: talk to the users daily, debug or design things, write code and tests, pass QA/code review, move on to the next thing. There is strategic product guidance and administrative assistance from our manager but the process provides for individual creativity and requires self-motivation. Most of the time (but not always: support and bugs obviously take priority), you have the freedom to choose an initiative to work on and to participate in roadmap planning. Remember that with great power comes great responsibility. Academic Interest in Stateful Distributed Computing on Modern Platform Architecture:This is the core of the innovation work we are doing today. We are solving challenging problems for our users and customers using the latest approaches in these fieldsPREFERRED SKILLS How Much Initial Erlang Experience is Required We work on multiple codebases, not all of them are in Erlang, some are really small. We'd consider any candidates with strong skills in any two of the following: Java, C#, (Python | Ruby), Objective-C, Swift, Go. Experience with a functional language would be a major plus but we're happy to let the candidate learn Erlang along the way. #TanzuThis position is eligible for JoinTeamTanzu referral campaignCategory : Engineering and TechnologySubcategory: Software EngineeringExperience: Business LeadershipFull Time/ Part Time: Full TimePosted Date: 2021-09-03VMware Company Overview: At VMware, we believe that software has the power to unlock new opportunities for people and our planet.
